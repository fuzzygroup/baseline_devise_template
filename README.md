# README

Hello.  I hope you find this useful.  Here's how to get started:

1.  Fork this to your own github.  That gives you your own copy of it.
2.  Clone it to your own computer so you can use it.  Now since this is a template that you want to use to build other things at this point I'd delete the .git directory and make some thing fresh from it but you do what you want.

# Assumptions

* RVM
* Ruby 2.3.1 or later
* MySQL or MariaDB
* Capistrano for deployment

# Todos

Please note that the work on environment variables here is preliminary and not really setup yet.  

Please note that while I have a baseline docker file here I haven't done much with it.  I based it on Nick's stuff: http://nickjanetakis.com and specifically on his ORATS generator but I haven't had time to circle back and finish it.  Pull requests welcome
